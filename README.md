Project for Rust course on MIMUW - implementation of DEFLATE algorithm.

Sample command running program: 'cargo run -- -window_size 1000 -max_len_of_block 20 -codes_predef 1'.
You can also see a message info with more detalis about about running command after 'cargo run'.

For this moment LZ77 is implemented, huffman codes will be soon (along with some multithreading options :DD).
